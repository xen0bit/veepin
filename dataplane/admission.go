// Admission control for unauthenticated peers.
//
// Every handshake in this tree costs a responder something before it knows who
// it is talking to: a session identifier, an address from a pool, a
// Diffie-Hellman computation, a buffer held until a timeout. None of that is
// recoverable from the initiator, and none of it requires the initiator to prove
// anything first — that is inherent to how these protocols begin, not a flaw in
// any one of them.
//
// What was missing is a bound. Before this, a single host sending initiations at
// line rate would make every veepin server allocate until something ran out.
// Expiry timers, where protocols had them, bound how *long* state is held, not
// how much accumulates in that window.
//
// Two limits, because they fail differently:
//
//   - A global cap on concurrent half-open handshakes protects the server's
//     memory and address pool regardless of where the load comes from.
//   - A per-source rate limit stops one host consuming the whole cap, so a
//     single noisy or hostile peer cannot deny service to everyone else.
//
// Neither is a substitute for a protocol's own anti-DoS mechanism where one is
// specified — IKEv2's cookie exchange (RFC 7296 §2.6) makes the initiator prove
// return routability before the responder does any expensive work, which is
// strictly better because it costs the responder nothing. This is the floor
// under every protocol, including those that have no such mechanism.
