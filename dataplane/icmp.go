// Path MTU: telling the host when a packet will not fit.
//
// MTU black-holing is the most common real-world VPN failure, and it looks like
// nothing else: the tunnel comes up, small packets work, SSH works, and then a
// large HTTP response or a file transfer hangs forever. It happens because a
// tunnel's usable MTU is smaller than the interface the host is routing over,
// and nothing tells the host that.
//
// The host is willing to be told. TCP sets DF on everything, and a router that
// cannot forward a DF packet is required to answer with ICMP "fragmentation
// needed", carrying the MTU that *would* have worked. The sending stack lowers
// its path MTU for that destination and retransmits. That mechanism is why the
// internet works across links of differing MTU — a VPN that does not participate
// in it is the broken party.
//
// Before this, veepin silently dropped oversized packets. This makes it answer.
//
// Only the two message types that matter are implemented, by hand: encoding
// ICMPv3 fragmentation-needed and recognising one on the way back. That is a few
// dozen lines and keeps this consistent with the rest of the tree, where
// golang.org/x/net/icmp would have been the only reason to take a new dependency.
