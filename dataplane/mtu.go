// Deriving an inner MTU instead of guessing one.
//
// Every protocol in this tree used to carry a bare MTU literal — 1500, 1420,
// 1400, 1300, 1200 — with nothing saying where the number came from. Some are
// the protocol's own documented default; others were picked because they
// happened to work. Two of them had comments describing arithmetic that does
// not produce the number next to it.
//
// That matters more than untidiness suggests. An MTU that is too large is the
// black hole ICMP handling exists to answer; an MTU that is too small costs
// throughput on every packet forever. Neither is visible in a test — both
// endpoints agree, packets flow, and the loss shows up only as someone else's
// slow transfer.
//
// So the vocabulary lives here: what a path is assumed to carry, what each
// layer of encapsulation costs, and one function that subtracts. A protocol
// states its overhead as a sum whose terms can be checked against its own wire
// format, and the result is derived rather than asserted.
//
// # Why the conventional value still wins in two places
//
// Nebula ships 1300 and WireGuard ships 1420. Neither equals what the
// arithmetic here produces, and neither is wrong: they are what every other
// implementation of those protocols uses, and an MTU is only useful if the peer
// agrees with it. Those two keep their conventional default, with the derived
// value written alongside so the gap is deliberate and visible instead of
// being a number nobody could account for.

	// DefaultPathMTU is what an ordinary ethernet path carries. It is the

// returning a negative or absurd MTU would turn that into a confusing failure
// somewhere further down instead of an obviously wrong number here.
