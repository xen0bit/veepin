// Traffic accounting for the data path.
//
// Before this, nothing anywhere in the tree counted a byte. client.PeerInfo
// carried an ID, an address, a state and a last handshake, so the management
// panel could tell an operator that a peer handshook and nothing about whether
// it had moved a packet since -- and the one question every VPN operator asks,
// *is this thing actually carrying traffic*, had no answer anywhere, including
// in the logs. It was also the missing half of the shaping and throughput work:
// bench.sh and the interop iperf3 table measure the data path in a lab, and a
// running server reported nothing.
//
// # Where the counters live, and what that costs
//
// Per tunnel, as struct fields reached through a lookup the packet path was
// already doing -- not a keyed map consulted per packet, which is exactly how
// counting undoes an allocation-free path.
//
//   - Inbound is free. decapInbound already resolves the demux key through
//     p.byKey, so holding the counters in that map's value costs nothing beyond
//     the lookup that was there.
//   - Outbound pays one pointer-keyed map read, inside the RLock it already
//     takes. The route trie stores a bare Tunnel and threading counters through
//     it would ripple into the trie's own tests for no gain: the outbound path
//     allocates in Encapsulate regardless, so this read is not on the path the
//     AllocsPerRun guards pin.
//
// Both are atomics, so a reader (the management API) never blocks the data path
// and the data path never blocks on a reader.
//
// # Drops
//
// Counted by reason rather than in total. "1,412 packets dropped" tells an
// operator nothing they can act on; "1,412 dropped with an unknown key" says a
// peer is sending under an SA this server has forgotten, and "1,412 dropped
// with no route" says the opposite -- a client sending to a destination nobody
// claims. The reasons are the ones the drop path already distinguishes.

// the data path writes them without a lock and the management API reads them
// without taking one.
