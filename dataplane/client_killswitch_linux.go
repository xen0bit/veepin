// The kill switch: what happens to the host's traffic when the tunnel dies
// without being asked to.
//
// ClientRouter.Revert restores the pre-VPN default route, which is right for a
// Ctrl-C and wrong for a tunnel that died on its own: the user asked for their
// traffic to go through the VPN, and it silently stopped doing so. Worse, the
// reconnection loop makes the window real rather than theoretical -- a laptop
// that loses its tunnel now spends the whole backoff sending in plaintext.
//
// # How it holds
//
// The routes ClientRouter installs for a full tunnel are the two halves
// 0.0.0.0/1 and 128.0.0.0/1, pointed at the TUN, which override the default
// without deleting it. This installs the *same two halves* as blackholes, at a
// worse metric:
//
//	0.0.0.0/1   dev tun0                  metric 0     ← while the tunnel is up
//	0.0.0.0/1   blackhole                 metric 100   ← the instant it is not
//	0.0.0.0/0   via 192.168.1.1 dev eth0               ← never reached again
//
// So it is engaged while the tunnel is *healthy* and simply waits. The kernel
// drops a device route when its device goes away, which uncovers the blackhole
// with no window at all -- whereas installing the blackhole in response to the
// teardown leaves however long that takes as plaintext.
//
// # The carve-out that makes reconnection possible
//
// A /1 blackhole covers the VPN server too, so with nothing else the re-dial
// could not reach it and the kill switch would be a brick rather than a switch.
// It therefore holds its own host route to the server, via the physical
// gateway, for as long as it is engaged -- at the same worse metric, so it is a
// distinct route from the one ClientRouter installs and is added and removed
// independently of it.
//
// This is why a protocol whose Result carries no Gateway cannot have one. A
// mesh reaches peers at many underlay addresses and there is no single one to
// carve out; engaging here would produce a host that can never reconnect. The
// caller is expected to refuse that combination rather than deliver it.
//
// # The alternative not taken
//
// Firewall rules (nftables/iptables) scoping egress to the tunnel interface are
// what a mature client does and are strictly better -- they also cover a
// process that binds a source address explicitly, which a route cannot. They
// also mean owning firewall state on the user's host, which is a far larger
// promise than owning two /1 routes. A blackhole route is the honest version of
// what this tree already does.

// killSwitchMetric is the priority the blackhole routes carry. Any value worse
// than the tunnel's own (which iproute2 installs at 0) works; 100 is far enough
// from 0 to be obviously deliberate in `ip route show`.
