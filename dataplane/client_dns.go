// DNS application for a client tunnel, and the reason it lives beside the
// routes rather than in the caller.
//
// A full-tunnel VPN that routes every packet through the tunnel and still
// resolves names through the host's pre-VPN resolver leaks the entire query
// stream, in plaintext, from the host's real address -- while the user believes
// otherwise. That is the failure this file exists to close, and it is closed
// here because DNS state and route state have identical lifetimes and identical
// failure modes: both are installed by Apply, both must come back on Revert,
// and splitting them across two components is what let the gap open.
//
// Two backends, chosen by what the host runs:
//
//	systemd-resolved   resolvectl dns/domain on the tunnel link
//	anything else      rewrite /etc/resolv.conf, restoring the original
//
// The split is not cosmetic. On a host running resolved, writing
// /etc/resolv.conf accomplishes nothing at all: the file is a stub pointing at
// 127.0.0.53, and resolved keeps answering from whichever link it already knows
// about. Only a per-link setting moves the queries.

// dnsBackend installs and removes the tunnel's resolver configuration. apply is
// called once, after the interface is up; revert is called at most once and is
// a no-op if apply never succeeded.
