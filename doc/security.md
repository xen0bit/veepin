# Security boundaries: what veepin does not protect against

Two boundaries are worth stating outright, because both are the kind of thing a
reader may otherwise assume is handled. Neither is an oversight — each is a
deliberate limit of a readable, self-contained implementation.

## Key material is not zeroed after use

Session keys, derived secrets and private keys are left for the garbage
collector. This is deliberate rather than overlooked. Go's collector moves and
copies objects, so a `[]byte` holding a key may have been duplicated to somewhere
the code holding it cannot name, and overwriting the copy that is still reachable
would clear one of several. Doing that would produce code that *looks* like it
wipes keys while leaving them in memory anyway — worse than not doing it, because
the appearance invites confidence the implementation has not earned.

The honest consequence: **veepin does not claim protection against an attacker
who can read process memory.** An adversary with a core dump, a debugger, swap
access, or code execution in the process recovers live session keys. Defend that
boundary at the layer that can actually hold it — process isolation, disabled
core dumps, encrypted swap — not by hoping the language cooperated.

## Per-tunnel throughput is bounded by one core

`dataplane.Pump` reads the TUN from a single goroutine. This is a scaling
ceiling, not a correctness problem; raising it means taking on packet-reordering
risk and lock contention that nothing here is currently asking for.

## MASQUE carries every inner packet on one reliable QUIC stream

Because `x/net/quic` has no QUIC DATAGRAM frames, CONNECT-IP runs in capsule
mode, so inner packets are delivered reliably and in order rather than as
unreliable datagrams. On a lossy path this reintroduces head-of-line blocking —
the classic "TCP over a reliable tunnel" pathology — and it is why MASQUE is the
one protocol here whose data path is not the profile the protocol is designed
for. It is a performance boundary, not a security or correctness one, and it is
confined to MASQUE; the moment `x/net/quic` gains datagram support the transport
swaps under an unchanged data path.
