// Package transport is WireGuard's data path: it turns the directional keys a
// completed handshake yields into type-4 transport messages and back.
//
// It is where the handshake stops and steady-state traffic begins. A Session
// holds one keypair — a sending key and a receiving key — plus the two counters
// that keep the AEAD nonce unique: an outbound counter that increments per
// packet, and an inbound anti-replay window that rejects a nonce the peer has
// already spent.
//
// The construction is fixed (ChaCha20-Poly1305, a 64-bit counter in the nonce,
// empty additional data) and taken from the protocol paper §5.4.6. There is no
// negotiation and no state machine here; rekeying is the handshake's business,
// and a fresh handshake simply produces a fresh Session.
