// The Manager is the engine. It holds the set of live listeners, each running
// in its own goroutine, and reconciles them to the on-disk config via Apply
// (initial load + on SIGHUP-style reload), and to per-listener edits via the
// individual Rebuild / Stop methods the management API calls.
//
// Construction is pluggable for tests: Manager.ctor defaults to client.NewServer,
// and the supervisor's tests inject a fake that returns an in-memory Server so
// the lifecycle, locking, status, and reconciliation logic run under `go test`
// without ever needing a TUN. The actual veepin binary uses the real ctor.

//
// It was called stopLocked, which named a lock it does not take and does not
// require: Stop, Close and Apply call it holding Manager.mu, and Rebuild calls
// it having released Manager.mu deliberately, so a slow Close cannot freeze the
// fleet. A name asserting an invariant that half the call sites break is worse
// than no name at all -- the whole -Locked convention stops meaning anything.
// The paragraph below about Manager.mu describes the callers that do hold it.
//
// Both waits are bounded, and Close is called on a goroutine rather than inline,
// because Close can block. The once-central cause is fixed: dataplane's TUN fd
// is held non-blocking and polled against a wake eventfd, so a Close waiting on
// its packet pump unblocks instead of hanging on an idle tunnel. But Close can
// still stall on any other blocking path a protocol owns (a wedged control
// connection, a peer that never answers), and this package's job is that one
// listener can never freeze the fleet.
//
// That is invisible to `veepin serve <proto>`: it calls Close and exits, and the
// kernel cleans up. It is not invisible here. stopListener runs under Manager.mu,
// so an unbounded Close would freeze every Status, Apply, and Rebuild in the
// fleet behind it -- one listener wedging the entire management plane, which is
// the failure this whole package exists to avoid. Bounded, the listener is
// abandoned with a log line and the rest of the fleet keeps serving.
//
// Abandoning used to leak the pump goroutine and its TUN fd until that
// listener's Close finally returned, or until the process exited if it never
// did -- so a fleet restarting a wedged listener on a timer accumulated one of
// each per attempt. Two things changed that, and they are different in kind.
//
// The leak itself is closed by client.AbandonableServer. Every server here owns
// a TUN, dataplane holds that TUN non-blocking and polls it against a wake
// eventfd, and closing it unparks the pump's read -- so a listener whose Close
// is wedged can still have its descriptor taken away from underneath it, and the
// goroutine follows the fd out. Abandon takes no lock the wedged Close could be
// holding and waits for nothing, which is the whole reason it is not just Close
// called twice. What stays abandoned is state, not resources: sessions are not
// told, nothing is flushed, and the wedged Close is still wedged.
//
// The cost of that is made visible rather than assumed away. Manager.Abandoned
// reports a gauge and a cumulative counter, /api/metrics exports both, and reap
// keeps watching so a Close that eventually returns brings the gauge back down.
// A server that does not implement Abandon -- none in this tree, but the
// interface is optional for implementations outside it -- still leaks, and the
