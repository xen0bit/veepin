// Package vlog is this tree's logger: log/slog underneath, with the
// Printf-shaped calls every data path already makes, and — the point of it — a
// level chosen at the call site rather than for the stream as a whole.
//
// # Why a type at all, rather than *slog.Logger directly
//
// Before this, every package held a *log.Logger and wrote one Printf per line.
// *log.Logger has no notion of level, so `-log-level warn` could only mean
// "send the whole stream to io.Discard": a protocol reporting a genuine problem
// was suppressed along with the chatter, and the flag's own documentation had
// to say so. Making warn mean something *within* the stream is what this is for.
//
// Going straight to *slog.Logger would have meant rewriting all ~480 call sites,
// because slog takes a message and attributes where this tree takes a format
// string and arguments -- `Info(fmt.Sprintf(...))` at every one of them, which
// is worse code than the helper below and a far larger diff to read. Wrapping
// costs one type and keeps every existing line untouched, so the diff that
// changes *behaviour* is only the lines that changed level, which is the diff a
// reviewer actually wants to see.
//
// Public API surfaces *slog.Logger, not this type: a caller outside the tree
// hands in a standard-library logger and this wraps it (From). The wrapper is an
// internal convenience, not something a facade's user has to learn.
//
// # The one rule about levels
//
// **Never reclassify a line downward.** Moving a line from Info to Warn or Error
// keeps it visible at the default level and makes it survive `-log-level warn`;
// moving one to Debug hides it from everybody who has not asked for debug. There
// are twenty-eight interop cells asserting substrings of veepin's own log output
// and a management panel that shows the stream as free text, and neither of them
// would fail loudly — they would fail as a line that stopped appearing.
