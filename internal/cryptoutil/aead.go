// This file is why the module has a dependency at all.
//
// WireGuard fixes its crypto: ChaCha20-Poly1305 and BLAKE2s, with no
// negotiation. Neither is in the standard library, so unlike IKEv2 — which
// negotiates algorithms and happens to negotiate ones crypto/aes and
// crypto/sha256 cover — WireGuard cannot be built on stdlib alone.
//
// golang.org/x/crypto is the Go team's own module and carries the AVX2/NEON
// assembly for ChaCha20-Poly1305. Hand-rolling these was the alternative; it
// would have been several times slower on the data path and a far larger
// security surface than the bundled MD4 in internal/ikev2/eap, which is a legacy
// hash used in one corner rather than the AEAD protecting every packet.
//
// These primitives are protocol-agnostic and named for what they are, like the
// rest of this package. IKEv2 can reach ChaCha20-Poly1305 through
// internal/ikev2/transform whenever its transform ID is wired up.

// ChaCha20Poly1305KeySize is the key length in octets for both the AEAD
// constructors below.

	return chacha20poly1305.New(key)

// NewXChaCha20Poly1305 returns the extended-nonce variant (24-octet nonce),
// keyed by a 32-octet key. WireGuard uses it for cookie replies, where the nonce
// is random rather than a counter and so needs the larger space.

// BLAKE2sSize is the BLAKE2s-256 digest length in octets.

// NewBLAKE2sMAC returns a keyed BLAKE2s-256 hash — BLAKE2's native MAC mode,
// which is what WireGuard's mac1/mac2 use rather than HMAC. The key must be at
// most 32 octets.
