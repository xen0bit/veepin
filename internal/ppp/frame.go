// Package ppp is a minimal PPP implementation for tunnelling IP over a datagram
// transport — the link SSTP carries inside its data packets. It provides both
// roles: the client (Session) does LCP link setup, MS-CHAPv2 authentication and
// IPCP to learn its assigned address and DNS; the server (ServerSession) is the
// authenticator — it opens LCP requiring MS-CHAPv2, challenges and verifies the
// client, and assigns the address over IPCP. It is transport-neutral (it sends
// and receives PPP frames through a Transport the caller supplies), so L2TP could
// drive it too.
//
// The framing follows RFC 1661, the control-protocol option format is shared by
// LCP (RFC 1661) and IPCP (RFC 1332), and authentication is MS-CHAPv2 (RFC 2759)
// via the internal/mschap package. There is no async-HDLC layer: the transport
// delimits frames, so a frame here is just the protocol number and its payload.
