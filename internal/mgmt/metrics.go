// GET /api/metrics — the supervisor's traffic figures in Prometheus text
// exposition format.
//
// The format is emitted by hand rather than through a client library, and that
// is a deliberate constraint rather than an inconvenience. internal/mgmt's
// dependency contract already forbids reaching outside the standard library
// (see README.md there), the module as a whole depends only on golang.org/x,
// and the exposition format is a dozen lines to write: a HELP line, a TYPE
// line, and `name{labels} value` per series. Pulling in a metrics library to
// produce that would cost the "no dependencies outside x/" claim at the top of
// the README for nothing.
//
// # What is exported, and why it stops there
//
// Per peer: bytes and packets each way, as counters. Per listener: whether it
// is up, and how many peers it has. Nothing is exported that the API does not
// already serve on /api/listeners and /api/listeners/{name}/peers -- this is
// the same data in the shape a time-series database ingests, not a second
// source of truth that can disagree with the first.
//
// Peer identity is a label, which is a cardinality decision worth naming: a
// VPN has tens or hundreds of peers, not millions, and per-peer traffic is the
// entire question an operator brings to a metrics endpoint. Aggregating it away
// would leave a total that answers "is this server busy" and not "which of my
// users is".

// handleMetrics writes the exposition. It builds on the same manager calls the
// JSON endpoints use, so a metric and the panel can never disagree about a
// listener's state, and so peer listing keeps going through the manager's locks
// rather than reading a live server handle out from under a rebuild.
