// Package pq registers "pq-openvpn": OpenVPN with the post-quantum contract in
// force -- ML-KEM key exchange and ML-DSA authentication, with anything less
// refused rather than negotiated down.
//
// It contains no protocol code, and that is the design. The variant injects the
// options that put the base facade into post-quantum-only mode and hands the map
// to openvpn's own registered parse function, so every default, every validation,
// every credential path and the whole construction sequence stay in exactly one
// place. A variant that reimplemented any of that would be a second copy of the
// base's surface, drifting from the first.
//
// The same reasoning is why this package declares no OptSpec table:
// client.ServerOptsFor falls back to the base, so `veepin serve pq-openvpn`
// renders byte-for-byte the flag set of `veepin serve openvpn`.
//
// See doc/pq-variants-plan.md; what pq- guarantees is in internal/pqpolicy.
